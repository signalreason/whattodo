# Decision Log

- 2025-02-14: Chose a no-build, static frontend stack (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS) for lowest cost and easiest local use.
- 2025-02-14: Selected 10 trait dimensions aligned with the spec examples (social, structure, cognitive style, hands-on, risk, novelty, aesthetic, impact orientation, time horizon, autonomy).
- 2025-02-14: Deferred any "see more" or "try different angle" features to keep v1 focused.
